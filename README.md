## Fast Word Histogram


</div>

### Description

To gather info on word frequency in a document.

This one is fast. I use arrays of bytes instead of strings to speed up the program. Compared to a string based version (like the one posted by lordaych, on 2/25/02 - called "Word Frequency Analyser"), this version is up to 40 times as fast.
 
### More Info
 
Input to be parsed is pasted into a textbox, so there are size limitations. A 30kb file will work, a 60 kb file will not.

Loss of hat, due to the blinding speed.

(Hold on to your hat!)
